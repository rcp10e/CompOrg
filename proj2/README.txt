All tests were performed by intializing memory addresses 100, 101, and 102 with
the values 1, 5, and 2 respectively. This was done in order to have numbers in memory 
to load into registers and perform basic operations.

proj2_test1:	tests lw function.
		tests lw fowarding to the nand instruction.
		tests the nand instruction.
		tests the data forwarding to add from nand.

proj2_test2:  	tests the lw function by loading the value 1 into register 1
		and loading the value 5 into register 3.
		tests the data forwarding for the add function.
		tests the beq instruction along with the data forwarding
		for the add instruction.

proj2_test3:	tests the sw function
		test the lw forwarding to add instruction
		
proj2_test4:	tests the add and nand functions
		tests the branch instruction 

proj2_test5: 	all hazards
